0.0.6
=====

- Radically change the way `_links` are specified in the serializer.  We no
  longer manually add a `_links` field.  Instead, a `_links` attribute is
  defined on the serializer `Meta` class.  The serializer then transforms
  this into a field at runtime.

  This begins a series of changes that will ultimately give birth to a
  `HypermediaSerializer` which is capable of serializing links and relations
  into multiple hypermedia formats.


0.0.5
=====

- Fix missing imports from pushing 0.0.4 without actually running it.


0.0.4
=====

- Reorganize modules.  Separate fields into its own module.


0.0.3
=====

- Version bump... I forgot to commit changes from version 2, yet somehow still
  ended up with a v0.0.2 tag pushed to the repo.


0.0.2
=====

- `_links` now properly returns URIs as `{ 'href': URI }` instead of just a
  string.
- URLs may now include query string parameters


0.0.1
=====

- Initial port from unb-djutils.
